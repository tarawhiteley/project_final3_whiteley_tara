- [Smooth Scroll](http://www.dwuser.com/education/content/quick-guide-adding-smooth-scrolling-to-your-webpages/)

    - I used this for my last project, so I realize it will not count for my jQuery requirement, but I prefer my sites to have a Smooth Scroll feature.

- [Quentin Tarantino Wiki](http://wiki.tarantino.info/index.php/Jackrabbit_Slim%27s_Menu)

    - This site provided information about the menu for Jack Rabbit Slim's restaurant in the movie Pulp Fiction.

- [Filming Locations Website](http://www.iamnotastalker.com/2011/03/10/jack-rabbit-slims-restaurant-from-pulp-fiction/)

    - This site provided me with the actual address of the building used as the exterior of Jack Rabbit Slim's restaurant. I used that address for the address of my restaurant on my website.

- [Fifties Slang](http://fiftiesweb.com/pop/1950s-slang/)

    - This site helped me research 50's era slang for use in my website, since the restaurant incorporates a 1950's theme.
